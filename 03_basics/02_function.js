    #  What is difference between regular function and function expression?
    => 1) regular function has name where as function expression is anonymous it does not have any 
          name but it is called by the variable name where the function expression is assigned
       2) regular function support's hoisting means you can call the regular function before it is 
          initialized or declared where as the function expression does not support's hoisting
          means you can not call the function expression before it is initialized or declared

  # NOTE:-1) Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or super, 
             and should not be used as methods.
          2) Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.Calling them with new throws a TypeError. 
          3) They also don't have access to the new.target keyword.
             Arrow functions cannot use yield within their body and cannot be created as generator functions.
